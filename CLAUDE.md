# Project Summary

This is a Unity project for measuring performance when loading a large number
of asset bundles asynchronously.

# Technology Choices

- The project uses the Built-in Render Pipeline for rendering.
- UI Toolkit is used for building the user interface.

# Source Code Locations

- Editable project source files are located under the Assets/ directory and its
  subdirectories.
- Read-only package source files are located under Library/PackageCache/. Do
  not attempt to modify these.

# Code Style Guidelines

- All comments must be written in English.
- Do not use documentation-style comments (/// or /**). We do not use a
  documentation generator.
- Use var for local variable declarations whenever type inference is possible.
- Omit the private access modifier when it is the default and can be omitted
  without loss of clarity.
- Omit braces for single-statement blocks (e.g., if, for, while).
- Use expression-bodied members whenever possible (e.g., for properties,
  methods, or lambdas).

# Workflow Instructions

- Focus primarily on writing or modifying source code.
- If scene editing or interaction with the Unity Editor is required, provide
  step-by-step instructions to guide the user.
- Write Git commit messages in English.
